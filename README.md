# REEFIT WEBSITE v1.0.0

Website showing the use of light/dark mode using vanilla JavaScript. This project is a one-pager that showcases what the client does. I also had to sketch the UI prototype on paper.

# Motivation for this project

The idea came about from the [JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/javascript-projects). I encourage you to check it out.
